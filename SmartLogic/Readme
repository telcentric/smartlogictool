SmartLogic Client
-----------------

The SmartLogic Client software is written for
	- ZTEX USB-FPGA-1.2
	- ZTEX USB-FPGA-1.11c

In order to build the firmware:
 - rename Makefile.default to Makefile.
 - download the ZTEX SDK from http://ztex.de and define the correct path
   to your ZTEX SDK folder at the top of your Makefile.

When you want to use the 1.11c version instead of 1.2 (optional):
 - change the folder 'fpga/SmartLogic.bin' in the Makefile to 'fpga1.11/SmartLogic.bin'
 - change selected FPGA in 'SmartLogic.c'
         //IDENTITY_UFM_1_2(10.11.0.0,0);  // select ZTEX USB FPGA Module 1.2 as target
         IDENTITY_UFM_1_11(10.12.0.0,0);   // select ZTEX USB FPGA Module 1.11 as target


 - run 'make'

The client can be run stand-alone or connect to the server.
At the moment the connecting parameters are still a bit ugly hardcoded in the client and server.


### TODO ###
- Make a list of things that need to be done.
